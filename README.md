# word-masters
This is a similar project to the Wordle game. In this game, there is a word of the day, and you are required to guess the word. 
For every guess, it checks to see if it is the correct word. If it isn't, it checks to see if there are similar letters in the word you guessed and the word of the day, and highlights the letter. The highlight proves the letter is included in the word of the day, so it gives a hint of the word. The game gives you six chances to guess the word, and if at the sixth time the word is still not accurately guessed, the word is revealed, and the game ends.
